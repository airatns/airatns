## Hi there. I'm Airat and I'm Python developer ðŸ‘‹

### **Projects**

* <a href="https://github.com/airatns/hw05_final" target="_blank">Yatube</a> is a social network for publishing posts. The user can create new posts, add pictures, leave comments and subscribe to other authors. With registration, authentication and authorization. The user can change and reset his password. Used pagination and caching. Tests have been written for code checking
* <a href="https://github.com/airatns/api_final_yatube1" target="_blank">REST API</a> for Yatube
* <a href="https://github.com/airatns/api_yamdb" target="_blank">YaMDb</a> is a database of movies, books and music ratings. I worked in the team as a team lead and developer. I have redefined User model, configured registration by confirmation code received by e-mail, authentication and authorization through JWT token
* <a href="https://github.com/airatns/hw_python_oop" target="_blank">Fitness tracker module</a> receives data about the last workout (duration, distance), determines the type of workout (running, walking, swimming), calculates and displays the result of the workout (calorie consumption)
* <a href="https://github.com/airatns/homework_bot" target="_blank">Homework Bot</a> accesses the API of the Practicum.Homework and notifies the student with one of the statuses: the work is on the review, the work is returned for correction, the work is accepted
* <a href="https://github.com/airatns/kittybot" target="_blank">Kittybot</a> sends pictures with cats. If access to CatsAPI is not possible, pictures from DogsAPI will be sent.
