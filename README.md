### **My Projects**

* [Foodgram](https://github.com/airatns/foodgram-project-react) is the project for publishing recipes, which allows users to subscribe to individual authors, add recipes to the favorites, download a list of ingredients of recipes they like. Authentication was realized via an Authtoken. Also realized filtering by tags and custom pagination, downloading a list of ingredients in pdf. The backend was developed in Python using Django Rest Framework. The API was used for server and application interaction. The project is deployed [to the server](http://46.18.107.21/recipes) in three containers: Nginx, PostgreSQL, Django. CI and CD configured via GitHub Actions 
* [Yatube](https://github.com/airatns/hw05_final) is the social network for publishing posts, which allows users to subscribe to individual authors, add posts to the favorites, upload images. If the user forgets his password, he can request the email with the recovery code and change the password. Also realized custom authorization and caching. The backend was written in Python using Django. The frontend was written in HTML. Models, urls, views and forms were covered by tests using Unittest. Also developed [REST API](https://github.com/airatns/api_final_yatube1) for Yatube
* [YaMDb](https://github.com/airatns/api_yamdb) is the community with users reviews of movies, books and music. The backend was developed in Python using Django Rest Framework (API). The User model was updated and extended by additional fields. Also implemented custom authorization and authentication via a JWT. The data was imported to the database from a csv file using Django management command
* [Fitness tracker module](https://github.com/airatns/hw_python_oop) receives data about the last workout (duration, distance), determines the type of workout (running, walking, swimming), calculates and displays the result of the workout (calorie consumption)
* [Homework Bot](https://github.com/airatns/homework_bot) in Telegram, which connects to the external API of the Yandex Service and notifies the student with one of the statuses: the homework has been sent for review, the homework has been returned for correction, the homework has been accepted
* [Kittybot](https://github.com/airatns/kittybot) in Telegram, which sends pictures with cats to users. If the Cats API is not responding, images from the Dogs API are sent
